#Machine-Learning
Machine Learning course from Stanford University

the repo will contain the coding asssignments provided by the course
##Exercise 1 - Week 2
Univariate and multivariate Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

##Exercise 2 - Week 3
Logistic Regression - the basic and the regularised variants

##Exercise 3 - Week 4
Still Logistic Regression, but regularised and also forward propagation for Neural Networks

##Exercise 4 - Week 5
Both forward propagation and backpropagation for the same Neural Netowrk as before

##Exercise 5 - Week 6
Analysis and visualisation of the Bias - Variance dilemma in Machine Learning

##Exercise 6 - Week 7
SVM with both linear and gaussian kernels in order to fit complex decision boundaries with as good a margin as possible

##Exercise 7 - Week 8
Unsipervised Learning (K-Means) and PCA; K-Means is used both to cluster point in 2D and 3D space, but also for image compression

##Exercise 8 - Week 9
Anomaly Detection by using gaussian distributions and a Recommender System which predicts movie ratings

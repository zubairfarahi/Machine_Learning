# Exercise 4
- full implemenation of a *Neural Network*;
- we calculate the gradients of the `Theta` and, by use of the `fmincg.m` function, we do
the *backpropagation* step of the algorithm;
- *regularisation* is still employed in order not to overfit the network;
- the gradients needed by `fmincg.m` are checked by comparison to the ones calculated
by means of the definition of the derivative.
